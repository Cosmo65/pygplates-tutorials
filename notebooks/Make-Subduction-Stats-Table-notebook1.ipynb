    "**This notebook can be used to extract subduction zone kinematics and parameters from a chosen plate model. These include:**\n",
    "- overriding and subducting plate ID's\n",
    "- arc length\n",
    "- lat and lon\n",
    "- time\n",

    "- migration rate and obliquity \n",
    "- age of the subducting seafloor\n",

    "**It illustrates usage of the updated subduction zone kinematics pygplates method, using the Müller et al AREPS model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- implemented to work directly on the plate model gpml files (whereas before, you had to export the resolved topologies at 1Myr increments first)\n",
    "- this notebook also interpolates the age of the subducting plate age from age grids if provided\n",
    "- within the notebook data are stored in pandas dataframes, and there is an illustration of how to export them to both csv or hdf5 files\n",
