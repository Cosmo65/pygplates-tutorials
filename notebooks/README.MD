Assigning plate ids to features
#### pygplates-fileio.ipynb
pygplates basic file I/O
#### pygplates-Flowlines.ipynb
This example details dynamic construction and plotting within a python script of synthetic flowlines generated from a plate model.
#### pygplates-Motion-Paths.ipynb
A motion path is a gplates feature type that traces the motion of a seed point on one plate relative to some other plate/frame of reference. 
#### pygplates-reconstruct-to-birth-time.ipynb
reconstructing a set of features to their 'birth' time
#### pygplates-topologies.ipynb
This notebook goes through some examples of how to work with topological plate polygons using pygplates.

#### plate-tectonics-over-time.ipynb
Recontruct variable datasets back in time.
#### mineral-deposits-investigation.ipynb
A commercially interesting application of all of this data and technology is to find valuable mineral deposits. We might be able to predict where new deposits will be discovered!
#### plate-tectonics-and-earthquakes.ipynb
This notebook contains some simple scripts which will help us to understand present day plate tectonics in terms of where earthquakes occur relative to plate boundaries.
