    "## Tracking points through a reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of having plate reconstructions with dynamically evolving plate boundaries is that we can define how a point moves through time, beginning on one plate but subsequently being transferred to other plates. For example:\n",
    "- a point within an oceanic plate that subsequently splits into two plates\n",
    "- a point on an oceanic plate that reaches a subduction zone (such that the crust may get subducted, or may become accreted to the overriding plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A geological example could be the products of a deep plume have ended up, assuming that \n",
    "1. the mantle plume produces seamounts (or thick crust) on the plate lying over it\n",
    "2. these seamounts then travels with the plate, but later reaches a subduction zone where it is accreted to an active margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through the steps of defining a point at some moment in the geological past, finding out what plate it is on at this time, then tracking the motion of this point incrementally for a series of time steps, testing to see whether the point still lies within the boundaries of the plate that it started on.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Technical details\n",
    "From a technical point of view, the process involves knowledge of:\n",
    "- resolved topologies\n",
    "- assigning plate ids using plate partitioning\n",
    "- modifying the geometry of a feature\n"
