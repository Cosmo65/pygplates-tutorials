# pygplates-tutorials
## Introduction
This repository contains jupyter notebooks which demonstrate how to use pygplates in plate tectonic research. The notebooks are designed to be a companion to the pygplates documentation. The documentation contains sample code illustrating in a general sense how to perform certain tasks; these notebooks contain worked examples on actual data sets.

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Download the repository 

```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/GPlates/pygplates-tutorials.git```

Note that this requires git to be [installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local system.
Alternatively you can download the repository as a zip file (and extract on your local system).

### Step 2: Pull the gplates/pygplates-notebook docker container 
install Docker https://www.docker.com/ if you have not done so.

```docker pull gplates/pygplates-notebook```

### Step 3: Run the Docker container 
in the top level folder of this repository(pygplates-tutorials)

```docker run -it --rm -p 18888:8888 -v `pwd`:/home/workspace gplates/pygplates-notebook```

Note that this sets up Docker to display notebooks in your current working directory (where you cloned or downloaded the Github repository).

### Step 4: Check the notebooks in a web browser

```http://localhost:18888/tree/notebooks```

## System Requirements:
If you would like to run the notebooks in your computer directly(instead of using Docker), you need to install all the required dependencies. 

The fundamental requirement to run these notebooks is to have pygplates installed (compatible with Python 2.7, but not Python 3.X). Installation instructions can be found in the pygplates user documentation.
Other python modules used by the notebooks are listed in docker/Dockerfile.

## Notes about Docker:
You don't need to read this section unless you are interested in learning a bit about Docker.

### build the docker image:
```
cd docker
docker build -t gplates/pygplates-notebook .
```

### run the docker container:
```
cd pygplates-tutorials
docker run -it --rm -p 18888:8888 -v \`pwd\`:/home/workspace gplates/pygplates-notebook
```
### push Docker image to Dockerhub.com
```
docker push gplates/pygplates-notebook
```
